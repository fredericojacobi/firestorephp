Erro consertado utilizando a vers√£o mais antiga do firebase php e token
https://github.com/morrislaptop/firestore-php/issues/15
I had a similar issue and it turns out i was using a newer versions of krait/firebase so i reinstalled them with a lesser version as suggested by composer:
"kreait/firebase-php": "4.15",
"kreait/firebase-tokens": "1.8.1",
and now seems to be working, hope it helps.
